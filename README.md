# Fabric Example Mod for 20w14infinite

This is a modified version of the Fabric Template Mod, generated from <https://fabricmc.net/develop/template/>. The goal of this project is to make developing for 20w14infinite easier by providing a standardized template for 20w14infinite modding, providing documented working libraries, and potentially in the future backporting further parts of Fabric API for 1.16 to allow mods that require more features like Dynmap to run on 20w14infinite.
